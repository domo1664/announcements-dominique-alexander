				<p> 
					From around A.D. 800 to the 11th century, a vast number of Scandinavians left their homelands to seek their fortunes elsewhere. These seafaring warriors--known collectively as Vikings or Norsemen ("Northmen")--began by raiding coastal sites, especially undefended monasteries, in the British Isles. Over the next three centuries, they would leave their mark as pirates, raiders, traders and settlers on much of Britain and the European continent, as well as parts of modern-day Russia, Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland.
					The new 10-episode season begins with Ragnar <span class="highlight">(Travis Fimmel)</span> as King and follows the great responsibility that now rests on the shoulders of the former farmer.
					With the promise of new land from the English, Ragnar leads his people to an uncertain fate on the shores of Wessex. King Ecbert <span class="highlight">(Linus Roache)</span> has made many promises and it remains to be seen if he will keep them. But ever the restless wanderer, Ragnar is searching for something more ... and he finds it in the mythical city of Paris. Rumored to be impenetrable to outside forces, Ragnar and his band of Norsemen must come together to break down its walls and cement the Vikings legend in history.
					The gripping family saga of Ragnar, Rollo <span class="highlight">(Clive Standen)</span>, Lagertha <span class="highlight">(Katheryn Winnick)</span> and Bjorn <span class="highlight">(Alexander Ludwig)</span> continues as alliances and loyal friendships are questioned, faith is catechized and relationships are strained.

					<p>
						Odin (pronounced “OH-din”; <span class="highlight">Old Norse Óðinn</span>, Old English and Old Saxon Woden, Old High German Wuotan, Wotan, or Wodan, Proto-Germanic <span class="highlight">Woðanaz</span>, “Master of Ecstasy”) is one of the most complex and enigmatic characters in Norse mythology, and perhaps in all of world literature. He’s the chief of the Aesir tribe of deities, yet he often ventures far from their kingdom, Asgard, on long, solitary wanderings throughout the cosmos on purely self-interested quests. He’s a relentless seeker after and giver of wisdom, but he has little regard for communal values such as justice, fairness, or respect for law and convention. He’s the divine patron of rulers, and also of outcasts. He’s a war-god, but also a poetry-god, and he has prominent transgender qualities that would bring unspeakable shame to any traditional <span class="highlight">Norse/Germanic</span> warrior. He’s worshiped by those in search of prestige, honor, and nobility, yet he’s often cursed for being a fickle trickster. What kind of literary figure – let alone a god whose historical worship spanned much of a continent and several centuries – could possibly embody all of these qualities at once, with their apparently glaring contradictions?
